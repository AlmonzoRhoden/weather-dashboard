<h2> Descripition </h2>

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. In this homework assignment, your challenge is to build a weather dashboard using the OpenWeather API.

Provide the user the ability to search for a city. <br>
Show the current and future conditions for that city. <br>
Present the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature,<br>
the humidity the wind speed, and the UV index (the color should indicate whether the conditions  <br>
are favorable, moderate, or severe) <br>
Add that city to the search history. <br>
Show the 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, <br>
the temperature, and the humidity. <br>
Clicking on a city in the search history present the current and future conditions for that city. <br>
